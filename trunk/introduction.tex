\section{Goal of this deliverable}
\label{sec:goal-of-this-deliverable}

The goal of this deliverable is to document every development and integration practice we agree
into the consortium in order to facilitate the development process between partners.
Since we want to offer maximum freedom in the choice of technologies of each component, this
deliverable will mainly focus on the tools and processes that will ease the collaboration like
source repositories, bug tracking system, documentation, continuous integration.

\section{Structure of the deliverable}
\label{sec:structure-of-the-deliverable}

In the Section~\ref{ch:preamble}, we will justify the choice of an SOA architecture for our
\learnpad platform and discuss the general choices related to open sources and closed sources
development. Section~\ref{ch:development-components} will be a general view of the development
process, from the first lines of codes to the publication of a stable version with all the
transitional steps. Section~\ref{ch:development-process} will develop and detail each of these
transitional steps, mainly in term of practices with some example of technical solutions to support
them. The integration plan will be detailed in section~\ref{ch:integration-plan}.
